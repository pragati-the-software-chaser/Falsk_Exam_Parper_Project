# Falsk_Exam_Parper_Project
Documents for Json read, write, update, delete application using flask framework in python 

GOAL: Created a virtual environment. Developed APIs to create a exam paper using python and flask. This API can read the json file and add new subjects, add new questions inside the subjects, Delete the question, delete the subjects, update the question, update the subject name. Used postman for testing the get and post methods. Convert the whole project in to swagger documentation.

Tools: Editor: Json, VS code, Python, Flask framework, Postman, Swagger

Step1: Created a virtual environment: 
Step 2: Created Json file (Name.json)
Step3: Write a source code in .py file (methods to read, write, update, delete the json) (Run)
Step4: Created a Flask Framework to convert the methods into API (Run via flask run)
Step5: Download Postman to test the GET and POST methods
Step6: Created a .yml file for Swagger. And separate the app.py and question.py files (to create get and post and provide the paraments)
